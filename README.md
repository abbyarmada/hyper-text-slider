# The God of Transitions

There are many CSS3 sliders out there. Most of them are coded purely in CSS just because it can be
done, but none of them fully utilize possibilities of CSS3 transitions. I belive we need more
powerfull slider component that focuses on features instead of technology, meets the standards
of todays websites and doesn't require few days of setting up and coding.

Hermes comes with:

 * configurable background an content transitions (and big transition library),
 * component-based approach (each feature can be enabled separately),
 * responsiveness (automatically adjusts it's layout to screen resolution),
 * extendability (expecially in adding new transtitions).
