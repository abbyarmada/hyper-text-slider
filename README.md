# The God of Transitions

There are many CSS3 sliders out there. Most of them are pure CSS just because it can be done, but
none of them fully utilize CSS3 transitions. Hermes is a CSS3 slider that:

 * has configurable background an content transitions,
 * is component-based (each feature can be enabled separately),
 * is responsive (automatically adjusts it's layout to screen resolution).
