## Responsive Controls

Adding class [hermes-responsive-controls][0] makes layout of slider arrows
dependent on screen resolution.

```html
<div class="hermes-layout--slider
            hermes-create-arrows
            hermes-create-dots
            hermes-responsive-controls">
  ...
</div>
```

By default breakpoints defined in [src/node/sass/\_variables.scss][1] are used
by the slider. Breakpoint values can be changed only when importing css in sass
code (see [CSS Import Options][2]).

```sass
// load default values of configuration variables
@import 'bower_components/hermes/src/sass/_variables';

// override breakpoint-related variables
$max-slide-width: 64 * 16px; // must be in px (it's used in calc expressions)
$breakpoint-normal-to-wide: 64em;
$breakpoint-narrow-to-normal: 38em;

// load css code of hermes slider
@import 'bower_components/hermes/src/sass/_styles';
```
