# Slider's DOM Upgrade Procedure

There are two opposing non-functional requirements for a slider component:
 * Declarations of between-slide [CSS3 transitions][transitions] should be simple,
 * Slider declarations in HTML should be simple.

[transitions]: https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-transitions/

First require complicated DOM structure, second require simple DOM structure.
In order to satisfy both requirements, upgrade procedure transforms simple DOM structure
declared in HTML into more complicated one.

## How it works?

Calling [`Slider.prototype.start(callback)`][slider-start] method begins
DOM upgrade, which consists of following operations:
 * Expansion of [option groups][option-classes] found on slider element,
 * Application of proper [layout class names][layout-classes],
 * Generation of [background][layout-background] and [content][layout-content]
   elements for each slide,
 * Addition of default [transition class names][transition-classes] to slides without themes specified,
 * Addition of default [theme class names][theme-classes] to slides without themes specified,
 * Generation of DOM elements for slider [control buttons][layout-controls],
 * Marking slider's and slides' elements as [upgraded][flag-upgraded].

[slider-start]: javascript-api.md#sliderprototypestartcallback
[option-classes]: class-names.md#option-class-names
[layout-classes]: class-names.md#layout-class-names
[theme-classes]: class-names.md#theme-class-names
[transition-classes]: class-names.md#transition-class-names
[layout-background]: class-names.md#ht-layout--background
[layout-content]: class-names.md#ht-layout--content
[layout-controls]: class-names.md#ht-layout--controls
[flag-upgraded]: class-names.md#is-upgraded

## Example

Following slider declaration:

```html
<div class="ht-slider ht-defaults">
  <div id="hello">
    <h1>Hello, HyperText Slider!</h1>
  </div>
  <div id="transitions">
    <p>How's the weather?
  </div>
</div>
```

...is upgraded into following structure:


```html
<div class="ht-slider
            ht-defaults
            ht-autoplay
            ht-arrow-keys
            ht-show-arrows
            ht-show-dots
            ht-responsive-controls
            ht-layout--slider
            is-upgraded">

  <div id="hello" class="ht-layout--slide
                         is-upgraded
                         ht-theme--white
                         ht-transition--zoom-out-in
                         ht-transition--bg-zoom-in-out">
    <div class="ht-layout--background">
    </div>
    <div class="ht-layout--content">
      <h1>Hello, HyperText Slider!</h1>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div id="transitions" class="ht-layout--slide
                               is-upgraded
                               ht-theme--white
                               ht-transition--zoom-out-in
                               ht-transition--bg-zoom-in-out">
    <div class="ht-layout--background">
    </div>
    <div class="ht-layout--content">
      <p>How's the weather?</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="ht-layout--controls
              ht-layout--arrow
              ht-layout--arrow-left">
  </div>
  <div class="ht-layout--controls
              ht-layout--arrow
              ht-layout--arrow-right">
  </div>

  <div class="ht-layout--controls ht-layout--dots">
    <div class="ht-layout--controls ht-layout--dot">
    </div>
    <div class="ht-layout--controls ht-layout--dot">
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```
