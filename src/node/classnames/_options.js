 *  1. **upgrade** - class name should be set in client HTML,
 *    slider will check for it only once during upgrade, adding/removing class after upgrade
 *    make no effect,
 *  2. **runtime** - class name may be added/removed at any time,
 *    slider will check if it is set every time a decission connected with this class is made.
